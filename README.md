### A BlockChain Based TextualContent Sharing Application

### Abstract::

The Textual content sharing system serves as a major backbone for resolving problems and providing security.Unfortunately, there are some issues with the existing system which can be solved using blockchain technology. In India, most  complaints of  people are not solved and even if the complaint gets registered , most of the higher officials are unaware of the complaints as most of them are being manipulated in between.This kind of problem can be solved using a decentralized platform for people to register their queries, which all the officials in that particular zone can access and take action immediately without means of altering the message. 

### Working Model 
When a user enters a complaint, it gets registered into one of the blocks in our blockchain system in a systematic manner. 
Once all the Blocks are mined, list of complaints are made visible to everyone over the network. 
As the content provided by user is stored in individual block which is then attached to the blockchain networks makes it impossible for anyone to alter the content.
